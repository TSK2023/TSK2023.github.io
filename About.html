      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Alex, currently 13 years old as of May 4, 2023. My intrests are tropical cyclones, other types of weather, and aviation. I also am a gamer... kinda.
        I created my channel on October 26, 2020 and have been uploading cyclone animations since, actually not really; I made a few gaming videos on there which are not on there anymore.
        I use Adobe Premiere Pro to make my animations, figma for the tropical cyclone icons and pretty much everything else.
